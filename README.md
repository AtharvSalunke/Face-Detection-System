# ðŸ‘¤ Face Recognition System with Live Detection

A full-fledged face recognition system using **MTCNN** for face detection and **FaceNet** (via `keras-facenet`) for face embeddings. This system supports both face registration and recognition using a webcam â€” all in real time with no manual intervention like pressing a key.
